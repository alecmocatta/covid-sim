^This mobile phone data would be used specifically for the digital app. If we include actual phone usage data and don't cluster by household, then we adjust the probability of any individual to be a user in order to obtain the specified proportion - however this is limited by a theoretical maximum and if our desired probability exceeds this, we'll get an error.  We don't currently adjust the probabilities if clustering by household - the proportion of households containing users will match the desired proportion but due to age dependent usage, the actual proportion of the population who are users will be lower.
NOTE: if we set the proportion of users by age to 1 for all age groups, this means everyone can be tracked and is more similar to standard contact tracing.

[Proportion of digital contacts who self-isolate]

[Delay before digital contacts self-isolate]

^This is added on to the time at which an case is detected and the delay for the case to be isolated, so in reality the delay is slightly longer than this - could change back if confusing?

^These parameters allow us to oversample contacts in the InfectSweep loop, in order to generate more realistic numbers of contacts (these contacts won't result in infection)
